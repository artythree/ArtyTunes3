# ArtyTunes3

ArtyTunes is an MVC for getting limited results from spotify data

##Installation
Download the zip file, and run in Visual Studio. The seed data is under models.  You'll need to "enable-migrations", "add-migration" and "update-database".

##Methodology
I used .NET Core, because it's the language I'm most comfortable with. Using the MVC scaffold from VS and the data from the Spotify Tracks Db, I created a very limited application to do some basic queries and display the results.

You can find the Unit Tests under ArtyTunes.Tests, and the dataset can be found at the link below.
